This program uses moviepy and pydub to generate video and audio of KK Slider. This program works like https://www.cameo.com/ where you can ask a celebrity to record a custom message for your or your friend's special occasion. This program allows you to request KK Slider to record a custom message for any occasion.  


This program uses the source code for the animalese generatorfrom equalo-official. It has been slightly modified for use in this project. View his project here: https://github.com/equalo-official/animalese-generator  


To run this code in your environment, you will need to:  
   * Install Python 3, ImageMagick, ffmpeg  
       * May have to configure moviepy with ImageMagick for your environment  
   * Install python dependencies  
       * pip install nltk  
       * pip install pydub  
       * pip install moviepy[optional]==1.0.3 (previous versions of moviepy cause errors in my environment)

This program has a lot of dependencies and is very RAM intensive. I've made this Google Colab Notebook where you can easily run the code using Google's computing resources: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14d4U6Yhi2APOhDjANS0SeBlKuCNeBTe-?usp=sharing
